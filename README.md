# Holy Angel University Campus Portal

This is a mock rework for the [**HAU Portal**](https://hau.campus-erp.com/) website. Even though this is not a school requirement, it will help me practice web development fundamentals along with UI and UX design skills. The website is deployed using [**Github Pages**](https://pages.github.com/), allowing access to the [live demo](https://enetwarch.github.io/hau-campus-erp/).

## Pages

- [`/`](./index.html): Securely log in to the Holy Angel University Campus Portal and access personalized academic services.
- [`/forgot-password`](./forgot-password.html): Recover access to your account through the secure password reset process.
- [`/dashboard`](./dashboard.html): Get a quick overview of your academic activity, recent updates, and campus announcements.
- [`/student-info`](./student-info.html): Manage your personal and academic information, including ID number, email, and more.

## Tech Stack

**All of the technology used in this project is front-end**. As this is just a mock rework, there will be no backend that will deal with authentication, databases, API, etc.. **No frameworks or libraries were used**, meaning all of this is made from vanilla web development languages.

- **HTML5**: For the semantic structure of the website.
- **CSS3**: Styles the HTML to make it look more modern and to increase UI and UX experience.
- **JavaScript**: Redirection and alert for the forms.

## Resources

- [**Font Awesome**](https://fontawesome.com/): Allows access for scalable vector UI for the website.
- [**Google Fonts**](https://fonts.google.com/): Gives access to fonts like [**Bricolage Grotesque**](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Bricolage+Grotesque) which is used in this website.
