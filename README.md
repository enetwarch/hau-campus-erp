# Holy Angel University Campus Portal

This is a mock rework for the [**HAU Portal**](https://hau.campus-erp.com/) website. Even though this is not a school requirement, it will help me practice web development fundamentals along with UI and UX design. The website is deployed using [**Github Pages**](https://enetwarch.github.io/hau-campus-erp/) so it can be viewed along with the source code in this repository.

### Tech Stack

**All of the technology used in this project is front-end**. As this is just a mock rework, there will be no backend that will deal with authentication, databasees, API, etc.. **No frameworks or libraries were used**, meaning all of this is made from vanilla web development languages.

* **HTML5**: For the semantic structure of the website.
* **CSS3**: Styles the HTML to make it look more modern and to increase UI and UX experience.
* [**Font Awesome**](https://fontawesome.com/): Allows access for scalable vector UI for the website.
* [**Google Fonts**](https://fonts.google.com/): Gives access to fonts like [**Bricolage Grotesque**](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Bricolage+Grotesque) which is used in this website.
