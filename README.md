# [Holy Angel University Campus Portal](https://enetwarch.github.io/hau-campus-erp/)

This is a mock rework for the [**HAU Portal**](https://hau.campus-erp.com/) website. Even though this is not a school requirement, it will help me practice web development fundamentals along with UI and UX design. The website is deployed using [**Github Pages**](https://pages.github.com/) so it can be viewed along with the source code in this repository.

> [!WARNING]
> The website can only be viewed on desktop wide screens.

### Tech Stack

**All of the technology used in this project is front-end**. As this is just a mock rework, there will be no backend that will deal with authentication, databases, API, etc.. **No frameworks or libraries were used**, meaning all of this is made from vanilla web development languages.

* **HTML5**: For the semantic structure of the website.
* **CSS3**: Styles the HTML to make it look more modern and to increase UI and UX experience.
* **JavaScript**: Redirection, alerts, warning popup, and dynamic DOM manipulation.
